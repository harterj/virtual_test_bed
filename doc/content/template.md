## High Level Summary of Model

High level introduction is expected here about the model of interest. Figures and tables can be added
in the model description, of which the examples are provided below.


!devel! example id=example-figure caption=Example of adding a figure in VTB documentation.
!media msr/msre/SAM_MSRE_1D.png

!alert note
One should put a copy of the figure at the specific file path.
The VTB media is now arranged by reactor types under the folder +/media+.
For more detailed instructions on figure formatting, please refer to
the [MooseDocs media tutorial](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/python/MooseDocs/extensions/media.html).

NekRS solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mass}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf u=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momentum}
\rho_f\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf u}{\partial t}+\mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u\right)=-\nabla P+\nabla\cdot\tau+\rho\ \mathbf f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy}
\rho_f C_{p,f}\left(\frac{\partial T_f}{\partial t}+\mathbf u\cdot\nabla T_f\right)=\nabla\cdot\left(k_f\nabla T_f\right)+\dot{q}_f

### Adding references style=font-size:125%

If the model has been previously published, one should provide the reference to the published works together with key references used for model development.
+MooseDocs+ supports BibTex style references, and some examples about how to cite technical report, conference proceeding and journal article are given below.

```language=bash
@techreport{Hu2017,
        address = {Lemont, IL},
        author = {Hu, Rui},
        number = {ANL/NE-17/4},
        mendeley-tags = {ANL/NE-17/4},
        institution = {Argonne National Laboratory},
        title = {{SAM Theory Manual}},
        year = {2017}
}

```

```language=bash
@InProceedings{novak_2021c,
  title       = {{Coupled {Monte} {Carlo} and Thermal-Hydraulics Modeling of a Prismatic Gas Reactor Fuel Assembly Using {Cardinal}}},
  author     = {A.J. Novak and D. Andrs and P. Shriwise and D. Shaver and P.K. Romano and E. Merzari and P. Keutelian},
  booktitle  = {{Proceedings of Physor}},
  year       = 2021
}

```

```language=bash
@article{Fang2021,
        author = {Fang, Jun and Shaver, Dillon R. and Min, Misun and Fischer, Paul
                and Lan, Yu-Hsiang and Rahaman, Ronald and Romano, Paul
                and Benhamadouche, Sofiane and Hassan, Yassin A.
                and Kraus, Adam and Merzari, Elia},
        doi = {10.1016/j.nucengdes.2021.111143},
        journal = {Nuclear Engineering and Design},
        title = {{Feasibility of Full-Core Pin Resolved CFD Simulations of
                Small Modular Reactor with Momentum Sources}},
        volume = {378},
        year = {2021}
}

```


The bibtex entries must be added into the VTB bibliography file +vtb.bib+.
A reference list will be generated automatically at the end of the VTB documentation page.

### Other key model details to provide in the high-level summary style=font-size:125%

- Reactor Type(s): e.g., Liquid Metal Cooled Fast Reactor

- Type of simulation: e.g., 3D core multiphysics (neutronics-TH) transient, 1D system steady-state

- NEAMS MOOSE Codes Used: Griffin, Heat Conduction, Cardinal, etc.

- NEAMS non-MOOSE Codes Used: MC2-3, Nek5000/RS, etc.

- Non-NEAMS Codes Used: Cubit, OpenFOAM, etc.


!alert note
More information is available online about [the list of NEAMS codes](https://neams.inl.gov/code-descriptions/) and the codes that have been used for [the models available in VTB repository](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/virtual_test_bed/resources/codes_used.html).
Providing the related information in documentation can better help the VTB team to categorize/sort the model.

## Computational Model Description

Walk through the main kernel/blocks, show snippets of example inputs when needed.
The markdown source can be as simple as the following to show the `EOS` block from the `msre_loop.i` input file:

## Results

Here one can document the most important results from the related simulations. Please refer to aforementioned examples about how to add figures and tables when discussing the main results and discoveries.


## Run Command

Please provide the run command for model execution on INLâ€™s HPC Cluster or otherwise. Below is a simple example how to run a SAM system modeling job.

```language=bash
mpirun -np 48 /path/to/sam-opt -i sam_input.i

```
