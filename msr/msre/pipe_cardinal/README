One has to unzip the mesh and checkpoint files to rerun this demo case
The original files are compressed to save space.`

nekRS simulation would require the following mesh files
```
tar -xvzf tjunc.re2.tgz
tar -xvzf tjunc.co2.tgz
```

A nekRS checkpoint file is provided, and can be accessed after doing
```
tar -xvzf tjunc.old.tgz
```

The coupled Cardinal simulation would also require the solid region mesh
in Exodus format, and it can be obtained by doing
```
tar -xvzf solid_hex8.exo.tgz
```
